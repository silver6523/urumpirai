... helps you to make decisions

## Vision

Sometimes you have to get rid of things but you don't now how to decide which things to keep and which things have to go. Urumpirai helps you making decisions.

## Concept

Decluttering means getting rid of things. To find them out of a group you have to categorize, value, re-categorize, value again and so on.

### Example

You want to declutter your bookshelf, so your things you have to decide on are "books". Now you have to find "categories" for example:

- Which books did I read?
- Which books did I like?
- Which are my oldest books?
- Which books do I want to re-read?

All these categories should give value to your "things".

In the next step you "value" your elements. Which gives a kind of weight to every "thing". The sum of these weights help you make a decision.
